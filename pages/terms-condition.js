                            <p class="legal-callout legal-info">We’ve included annotations in the gray boxes below to emphasize certain portions of our terms and help guide you as you read them. The annotations aren’t summaries, so please take the time to read everything!</p>

                            <p class="legal-callout">This page describes the general terms that apply to your use of any of our services. By using our services you agree to these terms on top of any other terms that apply to a specific service you are using (like Team Management, for example). If you use our services on behalf of your company, your company agrees to them too.</p>

                            <p>These General Terms of Service (“General Terms”) are a legal agreement between you, as a current or prospective customer of Prep’s services (“you,” “your”) and Prep, Inc.  Prep Capital, LLC, and/or Prep Financial Services, Inc., (”Prep,” “we,” “our” or “us”) and govern your use of Prep’s services, including mobile applications, websites, software, cloud-based solutions, hardware, and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”).  By using any of the Services, you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (“Policies”), including our Privacy Notice (see Section 8) and terms that limit our liability (see Section 18) and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 21), which are collectively incorporated herein by reference.  You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), such as those listed below, which become part of your agreement with us (collectively, the “Terms”).  If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms, and that business accepts these Terms.  You should read all of our Terms carefully.</p>

                            <h4 id="square-account-registration">1. Prep Account Registration</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">Provide accurate personal information during registration and keep the information current. We can suspend or terminate your account if you provide incomplete or false information.</p>

                            <p class="legal-callout">You are responsible for all activity on your account.</p>

                            <p>You must open an account with us (a “Prep Account”) to use the Services. During registration we will ask you for information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you must keep that information current. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your Prep Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted access to the Prep Account. We reserve the right to change the account type, suspend or terminate the Prep Account of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements.</p>

                            <h4 id="revisions-disclosures-and-notices">2. Revisions, Disclosures and Notices</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">We can make updates to our terms of service at any time, and we’ll notify you of these updates as appropriate. By continuing to use our services after these updates, you agree to the revised terms.</p>

                            <p class="legal-callout">You also agree to receive notices from us electronically.</p>

                            <p>We may amend the Terms at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable under the circumstances, by posting the revised version on our website or communicating it to you through the Services (each a “Revised Version”). The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version.</p>

                            <p>You agree to Prep’s E-Sign Consent. We may provide disclosures and notices required by law and other information about your Prep Account to you electronically, by posting it on our website, pushing notifications through the Services, or by emailing it to the email address listed in your Prep Account or that you otherwise provided to Prep. Electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. Such disclosures and notices are considered received by you within twenty-four (24) hours of the time posted to our website, or within twenty-four (24) hours of the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered. If you wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic communications, contact <a href="/contact">Prep Support</a>. If we are not able to support your request, you may need to terminate your Prep Account.</p>

                            <h4 id="restrictions">3. Restrictions</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">If you want to use our services, you can’t do certain bad things. If we think you are doing these bad things, we have the right to share your information with law enforcement.</p>

                            <p>You may not, nor may you permit any third party, directly or indirectly, to:</p>

                                <li>engage in any activity that may be in violation of regulations administered by the law. Prohibited activity includes but is not limited to the provision of Services to or for the benefit of a jurisdiction, entity, or individual blocked or prohibited by relevant sanctions authorities, including but not limited to activities in Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, or the Crimean Region of the Ukraine.

                                <li>use the Services for the sale of firearms, firearm parts, ammunition, weapons or other devices designed to cause physical harm;</li>
                                <li>use the Services for any illegal activity or goods or in any way that exposes you, other Prep users, our partners, or Prep to harm; or</li>
                                <li>otherwise use the Services except as expressly allowed under these Terms.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>If we reasonably suspect that your Prep Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Prep Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement.</p>

                            <h4 id="compatible-mobile-devices-and-third-party-carriers">4. Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers</h4>

                            <p>We do not warrant that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or carrier. Your use of the Services may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer or your carrier. You may not use a modified device to use the Services if the modification is contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including disabling hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jail broken.”</p>

                            <h4 id="your-content">5. Your Content</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">You retain all rights to your content when you upload it into our services, but you do give us broad rights to use, modify, display your content in our services. You can see specifics on the rights you grant us below.</p>

                            <p class="legal-callout">Also, anything you provide us or make available to the public through our services must not contain anything that we think is objectionable (e.g., illegal, obscene, hateful or harmful to you, our customers or us). We can remove any content at any time.</p>

                            <p>The Services may include functionality for uploading or providing suggestions, recommendations, feedback, stories, photos, documents, logos, products, loyalty programs, promotions, advertisements and other materials or information (“Content”).</p>

                            <p>You grant us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual, and sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display your Content throughout the world in any media for any reason, including to provide, promote, and/or incorporate into the Services. You retain all rights in your Content, subject to the rights you granted to us in these General Terms. You may modify or remove your Content via your Prep Account or by terminating your Prep Account, but your Content may persist in historical, archived or cached copies and versions thereof available on or through the Services.</p>

                            <p>You will not upload or provide Content or otherwise post, transmit, distribute, or disseminate through the Services any material that: (a) is false, misleading, unlawful, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, abusive, or inflammatory; (b) encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or gives rise to civil liability; (c) breaches or infringes any duty toward or rights of any person or entity, including rights of publicity, privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (d) contains corrupted data or any other harmful, disruptive, or destructive files; (e) advertises products or services competitive with Prep’s or its partners’ products and services, as determined by us in our sole discretion; or (f) in our sole judgment, is objectionable, restricts or inhibits any person or entity from using or enjoying any portion of the Services, or which may expose Prep, its affiliates or its customers or other persons to harm or liability of any nature.</p>

                            <p>Although we have no obligation to monitor any Content, we have absolute discretion to remove Content at any time and for any reason without notice. Prep may also monitor such Content to detect and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of Prep’s General Terms. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Content, including any loss or damage to any of your Content.</p>

                            <h4 id="intellectual-property-infringement">6. Copyright and Trademark Infringement</h4>

                            <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask you to do the same. We have adopted an Intellectual Property Policy regarding third-party claims that your material infringes the rights of others. We respond to all valid notices of such infringement, and our policy is to suspend or terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.</p>

                            <h4 id="security">7. Security</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">We take security incredibly seriously, but can’t guarantee that bad actors will not gain access to your personal information. You need to do your part by keeping your passwords safe, being smart about who has access to your account and which of your devices can access our services, and letting us know if you think an unauthorized person is using your account.</p>

                            <p class="legal-callout">If there is ever a dispute about who owns your account, we are the decider.</p>

                            <p>We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental destruction, loss, alteration and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You provide your personal information at your own risk.</p>

                            <p>You are solely responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to the Services from your compatible mobile devices and computer(s). You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or Prep Account or any other breach of security. You will immediately take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of a security breach and will cooperate with Prep and provide all information requested by Prep to remediate the breach. Any assistance provided by Prep in relation to a security breach does not in any way operate as acceptance or acknowledgement that Prep is in any way responsible or liable to you or any other party in connection with such breach.</p>

                            <p>Notwithstanding Sections 20 and 21, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any Prep Account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.</p>

                            <h4 id="privacy">8. Privacy</h4>

                            <p><strong>Your Personal Information</strong>
                                By using any of our Services as a Prep seller, you acknowledge our data practices that apply to you, as set out in the <a href="/privacy-policy">Prep Account Holder Privacy Notice</a> (the “Privacy Notice”). The Privacy Notice explains how Prep collects, uses and protects the personal information you provide to us where Prep makes use of your personal data to provide you with the Services or for its own purposes. You are required to familiarize yourself with the Privacy Notice prior to using the Services.</p>

                            <p><strong>Your Customers’ and Employees’ Personal Information</strong>
                                Prep will process certain of your customers’ or employees’ personal data on behalf of your business as a service provider (“data processor”).  In such circumstances, you agree that you will comply with the data protection laws applicable to you and will provide data subjects with information on the processing of their personal information which satisfies the transparency requirements of such data protection laws and which ensures that personal data may be processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner.</p>

                            <h4 id="communications">9. Communications</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">You consent to us sending messages to your email or mobile devices about your account or our services, which may include marketing. You can opt out of communications in ways that are specific to that communication method, such as by unsubscribing from emails, or replying to text messages with ‘STOP’.</p>

                            <p>You consent to accept and receive communications from us, including e-mail, text messages, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provide to us when you sign-up for a Prep account or update the contact information associated with your account. Such communications may include, but are not limited to requests for secondary authentication, receipts, reminders, notifications regarding updates to your account or account support, and marketing or promotional communications. You acknowledge that you are not required to consent to receive promotional texts or calls as a condition of using the Services. Call and text message communications may be generated by automatic telephone dialing systems. Standard message and data rates applied by your cell phone carrier may apply to the text messages we send you.</p>

                            <p>You may opt-out of receiving promotional email communications we send to you by following the unsubscribe options on such emails. You may opt out of any promotional phone calls by informing the caller that you would not like to receive future promotional calls. You may only opt-out of text messages from Prep by replying STOP. You acknowledge that opting out of receiving communications may impact your use of the Services.</p>

                            <p>We also provide Services that allow you to send short message service (SMS) messages to your customers (the “Seller-Initiated SMS Services”). You will only use the Seller-Initiated SMS Services in compliance with these Terms and all other applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdiction from which you send messages and in which your messages are received.</p>

                            <h4 id="paid-services">10. Paid Services</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">Lots of what we offer is free, but we offer paid services too. We can collect payments for a paid service by either charging your linked debit/credit card or taking the payment from your transaction proceeds, Prep-account balance or linked bank account.</p>

                            <p class="legal-callout">We’ll give you 30 days advance notice if we change our subscription fees, and you can cancel your subscription at any time.</p>

                            <p>Prep’s Services include both paid-for Services (“Paid Services”) and free Services, for which no fees are charged (“Free Services”). Prep offers certain Paid Services to be paid for on a recurring basis (“Subscription Services”) and others on an as-used basis (collectively, “Paid Services Fees”). Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms. By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes (“Subscription Fee”).</p>

                            <p>Paid Service Fees may be paid by debit card, credit card, or deducted from your transaction proceeds; however, Paid Service Fees related to hardware may only be paid by debit card or credit card. If you link a debit or credit card to your account, you authorize us to collect Paid Service Fees by debit from your linked debit card or charge to your linked credit card. Regardless of payment device, we reserve the right to collect Paid Service Fees by deduction from your transaction proceeds, the Balance (as defined in the Payment Terms) in your Prep Account or your linked bank account.</p>

                            <p>Unless otherwise provided in a Subscription Service’s terms, Subscription Fees will be charged on the first of every month until cancelled. You may cancel a Subscription Service at any time from your Prep Account settings. If you cancel a Subscription Service, you will continue to have access to that Subscription Service through the end of your then current billing period, but you will not be entitled to a refund or credit for any Subscription Fee already due or paid. We reserve the right to change our Subscription Fee upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice. Your continued use of Subscription Services after notice of a change to our Subscription Fee will constitute your agreement to such changes.</p>

                            <p>You are responsible for all applicable taxes that arise from or as a result of your use of Prep’s Services. For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to Prep under the Terms shall be paid free and clear of any deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Other than taxes that may be charged by Prep to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by law shall be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant taxation authority.</p>

                            <h4 id="modification-and-termination">11. Modification and Termination</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">We can terminate or deny you access to our services at any time, for any reason. You can also choose to deactivate your account at any time.</p>

                            <p>We may terminate these General Terms or any Additional Terms, or suspend or terminate your Prep Account or your access to any Service, at any time for any reason. We may add or remove, suspend, stop, delete, discontinue or impose conditions on Services or any feature or aspect of a Service. We will take reasonable steps to notify you of termination or these other types of Service changes by email or at the next time you attempt to access your Prep Account. You may also terminate the General Terms and Additional Terms applicable to your Prep Account by deactivating your Prep Account at any time.</p>

                            <h4 id="effect-of-termination">12. Effect of Termination</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">Once our relationship ends, we are not responsible for any losses you experience because of the termination of our services or for removing your data from our servers. Some terms of our agreement will still apply even after our relationship ends.</p>

                            <p>If these General Terms or your Prep Account is terminated or suspended for any reason: (a) the license and any other rights granted under these Terms will end, (b) you agree to immediately terminate and cease use of all Services, (c) we may (but have no obligation to) delete your information and account data stored on our servers, and (c) we will not be liable to you or any third party for compensation, reimbursement, or damages for any termination or suspension of the Services, or for deletion of your information or account data. In addition to any payment obligations under the Payment Terms, the following sections of these General Terms survive and remain in effect in accordance with their terms upon termination: 5 (Your Content), 6 (Copyright and Trademark Infringement), 7 (Security), 8 (Privacy), 12 (Effect of Termination), 14 (Ownership), 15 (Indemnity), 16 (Representations and Warranties), 17 (No Warranties), 18 (Limitation of Liability and Damages), 19 (Third Party Products), 20 (Disputes), 21 (Binding Individual Arbitration), 22 (Governing Law), 23 (Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute), 24 (Assignment), 25 (Third Party Service and Links to Other Web Sites), and 28 (Other Provisions).</p>

                            <h4 id="your-license">13. Your License</h4>

                            <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Paid Services, and a royalty-free, limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Free Services as authorized in these General Terms. We may make updates to the Services available to you, which you must accept to continue using the Services. Any such updates may be subject to additional terms made known to you at that time.</p>

                            <h4 id="ownership">14. Ownership</h4>

                            <p class="legal-callout">While we’re happy to let you use our services, you don’t have any ownership rights in them. We can act on any ideas you share with us about how we can improve our products and services free of charge.</p>

                            <p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in these General Terms. The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws of the United States and other countries. We own all rights, title, and interest, in and to the Services and all copies of the Services. These General Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks or service marks.</p>

                            <p>For the purposes of these General Terms, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property rights that may exist now or come into existence in the future, and all of their applications, registrations, renewals and extensions, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.</p>

                            <p>You may submit feedback, comments or ideas about the Services (“Ideas”). Submitting Ideas is entirely voluntary, and we will be free to use such ideas as we see fit without any obligation to you.</p>

YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST PREP. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</p>
